# 🌟 Problem 18: Implement Error Handling in an Express Application 🌟

Welcome to the eighteenth challenge in the Node.js problem series! 🚀 In this problem, you’ll learn how to implement error handling in an Express application to handle invalid routes gracefully. 💻  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Create an Express application that returns a custom error message for invalid routes (routes that are not defined in the application).  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Learn how to handle errors in an Express application.  
- Understand the concept of middleware for error handling.  
- Gain experience in returning custom error responses.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
18-express-custom-error-handling-node-problem/  
├── server.js             # Express server script  
├── README.md             # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json          # Project configuration file  
```

---

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you’ve completed the basics, try adding:

- **Custom Error Pages**: Render HTML error pages instead of JSON messages.

- **Different Error Codes**: Return different HTTP status codes for specific errors (e.g., 400, 404, 500).

- **Logging**: Log errors to a file for debugging purposes.
